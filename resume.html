				<div class="post-content" id="tagline-demo">
					
					<div class="tagline">
						This is a <strong>tagline</strong>, you can use it for extreme emphasis.
						<span class="fleuron"></span>
					</div>
					
					<p>This is some <strong>paragraph text.</strong>  All children, except one, grow up. They soon know 
						that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was 
						two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran 
						with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. 
						Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, "Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!"
					</p>
					
					<blockquote id="blockquote-demo">This is a normal <strong>block quote</strong>.  After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music.
						<cite>Aldous Huxley</cite>
					</blockquote>
					
					<p id="pullquote-demo"><strong>The following paragraph contains a pull quote.</strong>  None of them knew. Perhaps it was best 
						not to know. Their ignorance gave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their
						last hour on the island, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it. </p>
					<blockquote class="pullquote">Yes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is the end.
						<cite>Peter Pan, by J.M Barrie</cite>
						</blockquote>
					<p>They sang and danced in their night-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy song it was, 
						in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows, little witting that 
						so soon shadows would close in upon them, from whom they would shrink in real fear. 
						So uproariously gay was the dance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and 
						out of it! It was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the 
						pillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may never meet 
						again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy's good-night story! Even 
						Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but the beginning was so fearfully dull that 
						it appalled not only the others but himself, and he said happily:
						</p>
					<a href="img/peterpangirl.jpg" data-rel="prettyPhoto" class="img-link alignleft" 
						title="Tinkerbell by Massimo Barbieri http://www.flickr.com/photos/massimobarbieri/2685812402/in/photostream/" 
						><img width="260" src="http://placehold.it/260x100" class="scale-with-grid" alt="Tinkerbell"></a>
					<p><strong>This is how images look inline.</strong>  And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy's 
						story, the story they loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to 
						tell this story he left the room or put his hands over his ears; and possibly if 
						he had done either of those things this time they might all still be on the island. 
						But to-night he remained on his stool; and we shall see what happened. </p>
